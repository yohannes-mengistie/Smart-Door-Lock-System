# üîê Smart Door Lock System

## üìò Introduction

The **Smart Door Lock System** is a microcontroller-based security solution that enables password-protected access control using a 4x3 matrix keypad and LCD display. Built on the **LPC2138 (ARM7)** microcontroller, this system controls a **DC motor** to simulate the locking/unlocking mechanism and provides **visual (LEDs)** and **audible (buzzer)** feedback. It is designed for simulation in **Proteus** or for physical implementation with real components.

## üõ†Ô∏è Component Functionality

### 1. LPC2138 Microcontroller
- Reads keypad input via GPIO.
- Controls LCD, motor driver, buzzer, and LEDs.
- Implements password logic and lockout mechanism.

### 2. 16x2 LCD
- Shows system messages:
  - `"SMART DOOR LOCK"` at startup.
  - `"ENTER PASSWORD:"`, `"ACCESS GRANTED"`, `"ACCESS DENIED"`, etc.
- Driven in 8-bit mode (P0.0‚ÄìP0.7, P0.10, P0.11).

### 3. 4x3 Keypad
- Inputs password.
- Uses scanning method (P1.16‚ÄìP1.22).
- `#` key resets input.

### 4. DC Motor + L293D Driver
- Locks (CW) or unlocks (CCW) the door.
- Controlled via P0.8, P0.9, P0.21.
- Includes back EMF protection with diodes.

### 5. LEDs
- Red: flashes on incorrect password.
- Green: indicates access granted.
- Controlled by P0.12 (Red), P0.13 (Green).

### 6. Buzzer
- Audible feedback on:
  - Keypress (50ms beep)
  - Correct password (500ms, 1000Hz)
  - Wrong password (200ms, 500Hz)
  - Lockout (continuous + 500ms beep)

### 7. Power System
- 3.3V for LPC2138 core.
- 5V for peripherals.
- Capacitors for filtering and stability.
- Potentiometer for LCD contrast.
